= Why you should choose the ClickBank affiliate network? =

ClickBank is a huge marketplace for digital products that:

* Allows vendors to sell electronic products (mostly ebooks) without a merchant account
* Allows affiliates to promote these products and earn commissions Currently, Clickbank has over 100,000 affiliates and promotes over 50,000 products, making it one of the largest affiliate networks on the Internet.
* ClickBank affiliates have earned more than 1.8 billion in affiliate commissions.

= ClickBank Affiliate Benefits: =

As a ClickBank affiliate, you have instant access to over 50,000 products you can promote online. Most Clickbank products offer a very generous commission, often over 50% of the sales price. This makes it possible for top affiliates to make thousands of dollars each month. The products are ranked by popularity, so you instantly know which items are hot sellers. I have found Clickbank to be a reputable company that prompty sends commission checks every two weeks.
